# sismo-topo

This python script (jupyter notebook) uses the Dedalus package (v2) along with its companion Eigentools to solve the spectrum of a particular model of convectively unstable medium.

The script calculations should take ~2min on a personal laptop. They include examples of how to explore the data generated by the eigenvalues calculations.

In addition to typical python packages, it requires the version 2 of Dedalus (https://github.com/DedalusProject/dedalus) and Eigentools (https://github.com/DedalusProject/eigentools).
Warning: version 3 of Dedalus will not work.
